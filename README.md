# Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rany, thanks for checking out my github profile!

I love math and computer science, I studied Pure Math during my undergrad and I am always in awe of its beauty.

I am currently a Computer Science PhD student at the University of California, Irvine

## Some general questions I am trying to answer:
- How can we use methods from complex systems to make better AI/ML models?
- How can we use AI/ML systems to understand complex systems and the sciences at large?
- What is computation really at its core?
- How can we understand emergent phenomena and control it?
- How can we use deep math to build deep theory and illuminate AI/computer systems?
