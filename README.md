# Hello ğŸ‘‹

My name is Rany, thanks for checking out my github profile!

I'm a Mathematican/Computer Scientist and Full Stack Software Engineer who wants to be a Full Stack Computer Scientist ğŸ˜€.

## Software Stacks that I have used before:
- Django with Restframework
- Typescript
- Postgres
- React with Redux
- Tensorflow
- Docker

Not only do I love designing scalable, reliable, and functional software;

ğŸ‘‡ğŸ‘‡ğŸ‘‡ğŸ‘‡ğŸ‘‡ I also love learning ğŸ‘‡ğŸ‘‡ğŸ‘‡ğŸ‘‡ğŸ‘‡

## ğŸ“– Things I'm currently studying ğŸ“–:
- Information Theory/Coding Theory
- Foundations of Machine Learning
- Complexity Theory
- Computational Geometry
- Distributed/Parallel Algorithms and Systems
- Formal Verification/Type Theory

## ğŸ“• Things I've studied in the past ğŸ“•:
- Category Theory
- Material Science
- Battery Chemistry
- Renewable Energy
- Functional Programming

## ğŸ“š Things I want to eventually study ğŸ“š:
- Quantum Algorithms/Computing
- Chemical Reaction Systems
- Quantum Physics
- Database Design

## Some general questions I am trying to answer:
- How can I take state of the art research and deploy them in a meaningful way?
- What does it take to deliver projects on time?
